I feel delighted to share my Project I have completed during your intern journey.

1] Fake News Detection
  The Fake News Detection algorithm utilizes a dataset called "news.csv" and achieves an accuracy of 93.37%. It employs a TfidfVectorizer with English stop words and a maximum document frequency of 0.7. The dataset is split into training and testing sets, and the vectorizer is fitted and transformed on the training set. Finally, a confusion matrix reveals 589 true positives, 587 true negatives, 42 false positives, and 49 false negatives.

2] Sentiment Analysis
  In the Sentiment Analysis project, the goal is to predict the sentiment of a given text, classifying it as positive, negative, or neutral. This is achieved through a machine learning model trained on a labeled dataset. The model analyzes the text and assigns it a sentiment label based on its content. The accuracy of the model's predictions can be measured and evaluated using various metrics, providing insights into its performance. This project enables the classification of text into different sentiment categories, aiding in understanding people's opinions and emotions expressed through textual data.
